PhD-defense slides
------------------
These files constitute the presentation for my PhD-defense. Feel free to look at it and get inspiration (or laugh at my first puny attempt at making a presentation with JavaScript, HTML and CSS).

Libraries
---------
A lot of JavaScript libraries are used to make this happen:

* [impress.js](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/) is the main framework for the presentation. (Actually [this](https://github.com/tehfoo/impress.js) fork enabling substeps).
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) for general use by some of the other libraries.
* [RaphaÃ«l](http://raphaeljs.com/) for making and animating figures.
* [Flot](http://www.flotcharts.org/) for plotting the graphs.
* [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) for handling equation in a LaTeXy way.
